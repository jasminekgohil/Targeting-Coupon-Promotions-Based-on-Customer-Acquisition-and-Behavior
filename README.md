# Targeting-Coupon-Promotions-Based-on-Customer-Acquisition-and-Behavior

This project aimed to refine coupon targeting strategies by analyzing customer response based on acquisition channel and purchase history. Researchers designed an experiment targeting two specific customer segments:
* Segment A: Acquired through Instagram with two or fewer prior purchases.
* Segment B (proposed later): Acquired through Facebook with two or fewer prior purchases.

**Key Findings:**
* **Randomization Check:** The experiment ensured fair comparison by confirming no statistical differences in acquisition channel or pre-experiment purchase counts between treatment and control groups.

**Segment A Analysis:**
* Impact on Transactions: Sending coupons to Segment A led to a statistically significant increase in the number of transactions after receiving the coupon, compared to those who didn't.
* Impact on Revenue: While there was an increase in the average revenue for Segment A after receiving the coupon, the effect wasn't statistically significant, suggesting some uncertainty.
* Demographic Targeting: Segment A differed significantly from the overall customer base in terms of gender and income composition.

**Segment B Analysis (proposed later):**
* Revenue Increase: Compared to Segment A, customers in Segment B (Facebook users) exhibited a larger positive increase in revenue when receiving the coupon.

**Overall Insights:**
* Targeting customers acquired through Facebook with few prior purchases (Segment B) might be a more effective strategy for generating revenue through coupon promotions compared to targeting Instagram users with similar purchase history (Segment A).
* Further investigation into the reasons behind the different responses from Facebook and Instagram users could be beneficial for future campaigns.
* Segmenting customers beyond acquisition channel and purchase history could lead to more targeted and potentially more effective promotional strategies.

**Project Implications:**
These findings suggest promise in tailoring coupon promotions to specific customer segments based on acquisition channel and purchase behavior. While Segment A showed an increase in transactions, targeting Facebook users with limited purchase history (Segment B) might be a more effective strategy for revenue growth.
